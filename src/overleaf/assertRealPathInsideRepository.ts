 * That function does path arithmetic only, so a symlink sitting inside the clone and
 * pointing somewhere else passes it: `notes.tex -> /Users/me/.ssh/id_rsa` looks like an
 * ordinary relative path. Git can carry symlinks, so one can arrive from Overleaf, and
 * the paths we are handed come from a model that has been reading a co-author's prose.
 *
 * Resolving the link and re-checking containment closes that, and closes the matching
 * hole in the `.git` guard, which a link named anything else would otherwise walk around.
