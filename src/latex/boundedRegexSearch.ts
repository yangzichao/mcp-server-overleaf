/**
 * Runs the matching in a worker thread so a pathological pattern cannot wedge the server.
 *
 * A pattern such as `(a+)+$` backtracks exponentially in the length of the line: 24
 * characters take 150ms and 30 characters take ten seconds. Truncating the line does not
 * help, because the growth is per character, and there is no way to time a regular
 * expression out on the thread running it. Left on the main thread one search would stop
 * the event loop for longer than anyone will wait, while holding both the in-process
 * queue and the on-disk project lock, so every other client would time out too.
 *
 * `Worker.terminate()` does interrupt a regular expression mid-match, which is what makes
 * the deadline below real rather than advisory.
 *
 * The worker source is inlined as a `data:` URL rather than shipped as its own file so
 * that it resolves identically from `src` under the test runner and from `dist` in the
 * published package, and so its module kind never depends on a nearby package.json.
