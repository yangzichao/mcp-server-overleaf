/**
 * Removing and renaming a file, the two parts of the file surface that `write_file`
 * cannot express.
 *
 * Both go through the Git bridge like every other edit: the change is made in the local
 * clone, and `stageAllAndCommit` runs `git add --all`, which records a deletion or a
 * rename without either tool having to touch the index itself. Nothing reaches Overleaf
 * until `push_changes`, so a co-author sees a removed file only after a deliberate push,
 * and `discard_local_changes` puts it back until then.
