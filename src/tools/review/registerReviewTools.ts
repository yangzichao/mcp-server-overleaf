 * arrives as ordinary content, whatever track-changes mode the project is in. These tools send
 * the same kind of operation the web editor sends, with the tracked-changes flag set, so an
 * edit arrives in the review panel as a suggestion a co-author accepts or rejects.
 *
 * They need a session cookie rather than a Git token, so they are registered only when one is
 * configured. A server without it offers the other eighteen tools unchanged.
