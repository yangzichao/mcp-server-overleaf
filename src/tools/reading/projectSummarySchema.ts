 * before it calls, and gets the object back as `structuredContent` rather than having to
 * parse a JSON string out of a text block. Every field carries its own description because
 * several of them are easy to read as something slightly wider than they are — `mainFile`
 * is a guess, and `totalSections` covers that one file rather than the whole project.
