  inter-process locks, and recovery after rejected pushes and restarts.
- Local stdio and authenticated Streamable HTTP transports.
- Precompiled npm command, an external configuration file for npx, and version reporting.
- Locked dependencies, repeatable package builds, installed-package integration tests,
  and a GitHub Actions publication workflow with provenance and registry verification.
